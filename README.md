# X-Limb: A Practical 3D-Printed Soft Robotic Prosthetic Hand

Currently, the gap between the existing soft robotic hand designs and the practical requirements significantly hampers the potential to transfer 
these designs to real-world applications. These requirements are:
- Light weight (less than the average weight of a human hand) 
- Intrinsic actuation system (embedded in the hand structure) 
- Robust finger kinematic design and compliance in the mechanical design 
- Powered thumb for multiple grasping types 
- Ease of manufacture and personalisation 
- Sufficient functionalities and the balance between the functionalities and complexity 


The X-Limb hand prosthesis design addressed these requirements with the consideration of the trade-off between practicality and performance.

## Main characteristics of the X-Limb design:
**- Overall weight:** 253gr

**- Grasp types:** Three grasps types (power, pinch, and tripod) with capability of individual finger movement

**- Grip force:** Power grasp force of 21.5N and pinch grasp force of 10.2N

**- Hand closing/opening speed:** 1.3sec

**- Cost:** Bill of material cost of 200 USD (excluding quick disconnect wrist but without factoring in the cost reduction through mass production).
